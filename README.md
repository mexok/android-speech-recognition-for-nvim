Android Speech Recognition for nvim
===================================

This is a hobby project to provide speech commands to nvim via Android.

The main approach is to utilize Android's Speech recognition for capturing commands, sending all to a python flask backend and sending them to nvim from there.

The translation of speech to nvim commands will happen in the backend, so the Android client is thin.

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in this project or want to setup a similar approach for yourself.
